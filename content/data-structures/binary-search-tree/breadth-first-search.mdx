# What is Breadth First Search?

Works by first visiting all nodes in a level once, before proceeding to the next levels.

The reason it is called “breadth-first”, is it widens or goes broad in its search strategy.

# Javascript Breadth First Search

```javascript
// Binaary Tree Constructor Function
function BST(value) {
  this.value = value;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
}
//...//
BST.prototype.breadthFirstTraversal = function (iteratorFunc) {
  var queue = [this]; // add root node
  while (queue.length) {
    // remove & temp save first item in queue
    var treeNode = queue.shift();

    // run iteratorFunc on current node
    iteratorFunc(treeNode.value);

    // add child nodes to queue for later processing
    if (treeNode.left) {
      // if this node has a left child add it to the queue
      queue.push(treeNode.left);
    }

    if (treeNode.right) {
      // if this node has a right child add it to the queue
      queue.push(treeNode.right);
    }
  }
};

// example simple iteratorFunc
function log(value) {
  console.log(value);
}

var bst = new BST(50);
//...//
bst.breadthFirstTraversal(log);
```

# Use Cases for Breadth First Search

- hierarchy data
  - employees of a company and who they report to
    - top level would be executive employees
    - next would be the people who work under them
    - ... and so on all the way down
  - military officers and rank
