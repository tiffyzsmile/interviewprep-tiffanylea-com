# Technical Interview Process

1. Interviewer asks question
   - clarify question, yes even if you think it is clear
     - the interviewer may provide some hints or tips to steer you in the right direction
   - ask questions to help clarify scope and problem intention
     - How big is the size of the input?
     - How big is the range of values?
     - Input values
       - negative numbers
       - floating points
       - empty inputs
       - special characters
       - casing
     - Are there duplicates within the input?
     - What are some extreme cases of the input?
     - How is the input stored?
       - If you are given a dictionary of words, is it a list of strings or a trie?
2. Explain your high level approach
   - consider various approaches and explain out loud why it may or may not work
     - your interviewer might drop hints and lead you toward the right path
   - Start with a brute-force approach and communicate it to the interviewer
     - explain the time and space complexities and clarify why it is bad
       - you likely won't be coding the brute-force approach...
     - the interviewer will usually pop the dreaded, “Can we do better?” question
       - meaning they are looking for a more optimal approach
   - Only start coding after you and your interviewer have agreed on an approach
     - you have been given the green light
3. Start coding
   - general do's
     - keep code format clean and easy to read
     - use clear variable names (no single letter variables outside of iteration)

# Finding Duplicates

- Sort array, then compare each item to it's neighbor
- use hashmap with value as key
- Set() then back to array using spread
- filter & index of
- reduce
