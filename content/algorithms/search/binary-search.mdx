# What is Binary Search?

Binary search is the most efficient searching algorithm having a run-time complexity of O(log2 N)

Works only on sorted list of elements

# How does it search?

- Compares the middle element of the list with the target element
  - If target element matches the middle element
    - It's position in the list is returned
  - Else, the list is divided in two halves
    - The half that includes the target element is split in half ect..
  - Until there is a match or 0 items left
