# How is Fizz Buzz asked?

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# Fizz Buzz Broken Down

- for each number from 1 to num (num is passed in or provided)
  - if number is divisible by three log out the word Fizz
  - if the number is divisible by five log out the word Buzz
  - if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 log out FizzBuzz

# Javascript Fizz Buzz

```javascript
function fizzBuzz(num) {
  // using 1 instead of 0 is intentional given 0 would print FizzBuzz
  for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    // if number is divisible by 15 it is divisible by both 3 and 5
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      console.log('FizzBuzz');
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log('Fizz');
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log('Buzz');
    } else {
      console.log('i', i);
    }
  }
}

fizzBuzz(20);
```
