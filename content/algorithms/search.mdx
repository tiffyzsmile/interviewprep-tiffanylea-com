## What are Search Algorithms?

Searching Algorithms check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

- **Sequential Search:**
  - list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked
  - For example: Linear Search
- **Interval Search (Divide and conquer):**
  - specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures
  - much more efficient than Linear Search
    - repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half
  - For Example: Binary Search
