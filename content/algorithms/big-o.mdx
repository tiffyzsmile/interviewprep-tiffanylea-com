# What is Big O Notation?

Simplified analysis of an algorithm's efficiency in worst case scenario (very large input size).

# Formula

```
O(n)
```

- O: represents the function or algorithm that is being evaluated... "Big O"
- n: represents the number of elements/input

# Order of Complexity

|     | Big O            | Description                         | What that means                                                                             |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🤩  | O(1)             | Static                              | You know exactly how long it will take to run the function everytime (large or small input) |
| 😁  | O(log n)         | "divide and conquer", binary search | Break results into 2, eliminate 50% that doesn't contain item                               |
| 🙂  | O(n)             | Directly and linearly linked with N | How long it takes to run is directly based on how big N is (for loops)                      |
| 😒  | O(n log n)       | Merge search, like deck of cards    | ...                                                                                         |
| 😬  | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | Checking list and grocery cart      | Doing something against 2+ variable length inputs makes it exponential                      |
| 😳  | O(infinity)      | Flipping a coin                     | There is a chance the coin may never turn up heads and would have to go on forever          |

# General Rules

1. Certain terms **dominate** others, drop lower order terms

<CodeWithHtml>
  O(1) &lt; O(log n) &lt; O(n) &lt; O(n log n) &lt; O(n<sup>2</sup>) &lt; O(2<sup>n</sup>) &lt;
  O(n!)
</CodeWithHtml>

2. Ignore constants

```
5n -> n -> O(n)
```

## Example

<CodeWithHtml>
  T(n) = 17n<sup>4</sup> + 3n<sup>3</sup> + 4n + 8
</CodeWithHtml>
1. O(n<sup>4</sup>) dominates over O(n<sup>3</sup>) O(n) O(1)
<CodeWithHtml>
  T(n) = 17n<sup>4</sup>
</CodeWithHtml>
2. Ignore constants
<CodeWithHtml>
  T(n) = O(n<sup>4</sup>)
</CodeWithHtml>
