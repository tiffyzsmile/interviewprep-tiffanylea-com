# What are Logarithms?

- Answers the question:
  - How many of one number do we multiply to get another number?

## Example 1

How many 2s do we multiply to get 8?

**2 × 2 × 2 = 8**

We write "the number of 2s we need to multiply to get 8 is 3" as:

**log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3**

The number we multiply is called the "base", so we can say:

- the logarithm of 8 with base 2 is 3
- log base 2 of 8 is 3
- the base-2 log of 8 is 3

## Example 2

**log<sub>5</sub>(625) = ?**

**5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625**

**log<sub>5</sub>(625) = 4**

## Example 3

**log<sub>2</sub>(64) = ?**

**2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 64**

**log<sub>2</sub>(64) = 6**
