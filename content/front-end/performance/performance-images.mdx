# General Image Optimization

- use compression/optimization tools to lower file size
- Use vector images whenever possible alongside your PNGs and JPGs
- Use a CDN to serve up your images fast to visitors across the globe
- In some cases, you might want to lazy load images for faster first-page render
- Use Progressive images (speaks more to perceived performance)
  - progressive images load immediately with a low resolution and then increase their resolution as the website loads completely

# Choose the right File Format for Image

<img class="imgPadding" src="/files/images/image-file-types.jpg" alt="Image File Types" />

# Responsive Image Sizes

<img
  class="imgPadding"
  src="/files/images/css-tricks-responsive-images-article.png"
  alt="Load the right image and only the right image"
/>

Basically... don't load the bigger 800x600 image in a mobile view where the image is actually 200x100.
