# What is an Algorithm?

A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

# Properties of Algorithms

1. Input - An algorithm has input values from a specified set.
2. Output - From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution to the problem.
3. Definiteness - The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.
4. Correctness - An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.
5. Finiteness - An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps large) number of steps for any input in the set.
6. Effectiveness - It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount of time.
7. Generality - The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a particular set of input values

# Measuring Algorithms

- Algorithm times measured in terms of growth of an algorithm
- Algorithm times written in [Big O notation](/algorithms/bigo)

# Vocabulary/Terms

## Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to analyze an algorithm’s running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases (aka an algorithm’s growth rate)

- Does the algorithm suddenly become incredibly slow when the input size grows?
- Does it mostly maintain its quick run time as the input size increases?

### Types of Asymptotic Notations

- [Big-O Notation](/algorithms/bigo) (O-notation): worst-case
- Omega Notation (Ω-notation): best-case
- Theta Notation (Θ-notation): average-case
