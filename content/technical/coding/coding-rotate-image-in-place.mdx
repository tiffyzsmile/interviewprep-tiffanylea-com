# Q: Rotate Image in Place

Note: Try to solve this task in-place (with O(1) additional memory), since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

You are given an n x n 2D matrix that represents an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

## Example

```javascript
// Input
a = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];

rotateImage(a);

// Output
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3],
];
```

## Solution
