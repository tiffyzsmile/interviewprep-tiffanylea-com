# Q: First Duplicate in Array

Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index.

In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

### Example

- For a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) \$: 3.

  - There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3
  - The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.

- For a = [2, 2], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) \$: 2;
- For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be firstDuplicate(a) \$: -1.

### Solution

- create a new set or hashmap
- loop through each item in the array
- if item already exists in set or hashmap it is a duplicate
  - this is the first duplicate item
  - return item as result
- else add item to set or hashmap
- if no items have duplicates return -1

```javascript
const firstDuplicate = (a) => {
  const results = new Set();
  for (item of a)
    if (results.has(item)) {
      return item;
    } else {
      results.add(item);
    }
  return -1;
};

function firstDuplicate(a) {
  const findings = {};
  // using for loop so we can break out of it
  for (item of a) {
    if (findings[item]) {
      return item;
    } else {
      findings[item] = 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```
