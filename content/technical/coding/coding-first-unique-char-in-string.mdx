# Q: First Unique Char in String

Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '\_'.

## Example

- For s = "abacabad", the output should be

  `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) $: 'c'`

  There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

- For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be

  `firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) $: '_'`

  There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.

## Solution

- Split string and loop over each character
- If indexOf and lastIndexOf are equal it means there is only 1 occurrence
  - This is the first instance of a unique character
  - Return this as the result
- If no items pass return '\_'

```javascript
function firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) {
  var arr = s.split('');

  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var chr = arr[i];
    if (arr.indexOf(arr[i]) == arr.lastIndexOf(arr[i])) {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }

  return '_';
}
```
